# pairwise_stable_networks
Code to accompany "On the Probability of Existence of Pairwise Stable Networks in Large Random Network Formation Settings"

The code contains two modules: 

## nonexistence_in_distance_based_setting.py 

This module loads the counterexample of Example 1, and performs a brute-force verification that no pairwise stable network exists with the specified linking costs.
